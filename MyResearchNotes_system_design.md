# MyResearchNotes Blog System Design

## Implementation approach

### Technology Stack
- **Hugo**: A static site generator that will compile our markdown posts and templates into a static website
- **GitHub Pages**: For hosting the blog, which has built-in Hugo support
- **Hugo templates**: Hugo's templating language for creating dynamic content
- **SCSS**: For advanced styling capabilities with variables and nesting
- **JavaScript**: For interactive elements like category filtering

### Frameworks and Libraries
- **Google Fonts (Inter)**: For typography as specified in the style guide
- **Hugo Builtâ€‘in Features**:
  - Automatic RSS generation
  - SEO meta tags via partial templates
  - Built-in pagination

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Setup Hugo Structure**: Implement the basic Hugo folder structure with `layouts`, `partials`, `assets`, etc.
2. **Create Base Templates**: Develop the default, home, and post layouts
3. **Style Implementation**: Create the SCSS files following the provided style guide
4. **Interactive Features**: Implement the category filtering using JavaScript
5. **Content Creation**: Add sample post content to demonstrate the functionality

### Difficult Points and Solutions

1. **Category Filtering**
   - Challenge: Implementing dynamic client-side filtering
   - Solution: Use JavaScript to toggle visibility of post cards based on data-category attributes

2. **Responsive Design**
   - Challenge: Ensuring the blog looks good on all device sizes
   - Solution: Use CSS Grid and media queries for a responsive layout

3. **Share Button Behavior**
   - Challenge: Creating floating share buttons that appear on scroll
   - Solution: Use JavaScript to detect scroll position and toggle visibility

4. **Image Optimization**
   - Challenge: Handling different image sizes for thumbnails and hero images
   - Solution: Use proper image sizing and optimization techniques

## Data structures and interfaces

The system will use the following data structures:

1. **Post**: Represents a blog post with front matter metadata
2. **Site**: Hugo's global site configuration and collections
3. **Page**: Represents individual pages like about.md
4. **Category**: A classification for posts

The interfaces will be primarily through Hugo's Go template language, which allows accessing these data structures in HTML templates.

## Program call flow

1. **Initialization**:
   - Hugo reads `config.toml` for site configuration
   - Hugo processes all Markdown files in `content/posts/`

2. **Page Generation**:
   - For each post/page, Hugo applies the appropriate layout template
   - Hugo templates tags in templates access post/site data
   - SCSS is compiled to CSS

3. **User Interaction**:
   - User visits the blog homepage
   - User can filter posts by category using the filter.js script
   - User can navigate to individual post pages
   - User can share posts via the share buttons

## Anything UNCLEAR

1. **Custom Domain Setup**: While CNAME is mentioned as optional, specific instructions for setting up a custom domain might be needed if the user decides to use one.

2. **Image Handling**: The requirements specify image paths but don't detail how images should be handled or optimized. We'll assume standard image optimization practices.

3. **SEO Requirements**: Beyond the default meta tags provided by Hugo partials, specific SEO requirements aren't detailed. We'll implement standard SEO best practices.

4. **Analytics**: No analytics requirements are specified. If needed, Google Analytics or similar could be added later.

5. **Commenting System**: No commenting system is mentioned. If user interaction is desired, a system like Disqus could be added.
